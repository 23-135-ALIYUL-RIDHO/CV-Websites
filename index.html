            My name is Aliyul Ridho, and I was born on January 6th, 2005, in the vibrant town of Bangkalan. As a 19-year-old young man, I'm on a quest to become an elite global figure. Growing up in Bangkalan has exposed me to diverse cultures and languages, igniting my passion for linguistic exploration.

            Currently, I reside in Bancaran, Sabaneh Village, where I'm immersed in a culturally rich environment. I'm proud to say that I'm fluent in Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese, English, Javanese, and Maduranese. These languages not only reflect my dedication to learning but also my adaptability to different cultures.

            While I'm not yet employed, my motivation burns brightly. I envision myself making a significant impact on the global stage, representing my roots and contributing positively to society. Guided by my Muslim faith, I hold integrity, hard work, and compassion close to my heart.

            In my spare time, I indulge in reading, learning new languages, and participating in community activities. I view each experience as a stepping stone for personal and professional growth, and I'm determined to seize every opportunity that comes my way.

            As I embark on this journey, I remain committed to continuous self-improvement. With a blend of determination and a diverse skill set, I'm confident in my ability to carve out a meaningful path and inspire others to pursue their dreams.

            During my three-month internship at Ngudia Husada Madura Campus as an IT Staff, I gained valuable and diverse experience in the field of information technology. As an IT Staff, my responsibilities included hardware and software maintenance, network troubleshooting, and supporting daily IT needs.

            Firstly, I was involved in hardware maintenance, including installation, repair, and upgrading of computer hardware. I also ensured that the hardware operated optimally, thus ensuring stable system performance.
            
            Additionally, I was involved in software management, including installation, updates, and upgrades of operating systems and applications. This helped me understand software management processes better and enhanced my technical skills.
            
            As an IT Staff, I also played a role in troubleshooting network-related issues. I learned how to analyze and address network problems such as connectivity issues and slow internet speeds, as well as reconfiguring network devices when necessary.
            
            During this internship, I also had the opportunity to collaborate with experienced IT teams, which helped me gain a deeper understanding of the IT industry and best practices in the field.
            
            Overall, my internship experience at Ngudia Husada Madura Campus as an IT Staff provided me with a strong foundation for my career in information technology. I gained valuable knowledge and skills and expanded my professional network. I am confident that this experience will be a valuable asset as I pursue my career in the future.</p>
